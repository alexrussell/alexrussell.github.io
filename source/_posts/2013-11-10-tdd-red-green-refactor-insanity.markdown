title: "The Insanity of TDD's 'red, green, refactor' Mantra"
---

Okay a very leading title. Basically I have no problem with the idea of red, green, refactor. My problem is with the interpretation of that by the majority of people who teach it. Most people teach that the first thing you need to do is write the test and run the test suite. The test should fail (as the code should not yet be written). The next thing you do is write as little code as possible to make the test pass.
